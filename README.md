 Experimental projcts

 
Throughout Janell baxters 'Intro to programming class', I have created many incomplete text games, and experimenal codes to try implement new features that can be used in a text based game. I have created a fully explorable map in my "Dynamic Design" project which allows you navigate between four different inter-connected rooms. In the same project I have also made a code that alows the cahracter to end the program manually instead of having to X ut the console window. In my adventure games I thought up a way to ensure that the player could not progress without ntering a valid response.

Thess are some of the projects that I am most proud of...
# Projects
- Map Navigator:
  In this experimental program, you are plopped into a series of 3 rooms that are all conncted by a fourth room. Using booleans, the program tracks te players location and acts accordingly based on what which room you are in. The program will run forevr unil you enter the command to exit the game yourself.
- The Fish Union! 
 The Fish Union was my midterm project for the class. It is a text based adventure in which you play as a fisherman/woman in the port town of MerBerg atempting to save your baot from a crowd of walking fish that are rioting after becomig fed up with the residents of the town for consistently kidnapping them ad their families, and selling them on the streets to be eaten. However, the task is not easy. Crowds of angry fish swarm the streets, doin everything in there power to cause havoc and prevent you from reaching your goal. hat is no the only problem though. Annoyed with the influx in new residents arriving in the city, the odler denizens of merberg will not be inclined to do you any favors, wllingly at least.
 Extort items from your fellow residents, save yor livelyhood, and by jove, please don't anger the fish.
 Enjoy the game!
