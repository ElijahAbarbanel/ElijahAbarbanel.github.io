What I Have done in 'Intro to Programing'
- Throughout Janell baxters 'Intro to programming class', I have created many incomplete text games, and experimenal codes to try implement new features that can be used in a text based game. I have created a fully explorable map in my "Dynamic Design" project which allows you navigate between four different inter-connected rooms. In the same project I have also made a code that alows the cahracter to end the program manually instead of having to X ut the console window. In my adventure games I thought up a way to ensure that the player could not progress without ntering a valid response.
